    GOALS: 

    *** Determine how much of each PO we should fill. 
    *** Calculate the total expected penalty we incur. 

    we can do this by
    1. figuring out the brands with the highest penalty rate (and also their fillRateTarget)
    2. then, we sort the brands from highest penalty rate to lowest penalty rate. 
    3. once we know that, we can sort the purchase orders based on brand. 
    4. once POs are sorted, we can start filling based on fill rate target for each brand. 
    5. return the total amount of orders shipped, along with the total penalty amount
